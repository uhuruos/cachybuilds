# IPv6 Privacy Extensions (RFC 4941)
# ---
# IPv6 typically uses a device's MAC address when choosing an IPv6 address
# to use in autoconfiguration. Privacy extensions allow using a randomly
# generated IPv6 address, which increases privacy.
#
# Acceptable values:
#    0 - donâ€™t use privacy extensions.
#    1 - generate privacy addresses
#    2 - prefer privacy addresses and use them over the normal addresses.
net.ipv6.conf.all.use_tempaddr = 2
net.ipv6.conf.default.use_tempaddr = 2

# Turn on Source Address Verification in all interfaces to
# prevent some spoofing attacks.
net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter=2
net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter=2
